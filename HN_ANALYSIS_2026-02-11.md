## 🎯 Action Items for Autoschei

1. **Benchmark against entire.io** - What do they have that we don't?
2. **Knowledge graph integration** - Add to memogo (like Rowboat)
3. **Multimodal support** - Vision + audio in gommander/goview
4. **Social singularity hedge** - Focus on USEFUL tools, not hype

---

## 💡 Key Insight

> The singularity is human attention, not machine capability.

**Strategy implication**: Build tools that REDUCE cognitive load, not tools that generate more content to process.

**GoBro philosophy**: Do the work autonomously, report results concisely.
